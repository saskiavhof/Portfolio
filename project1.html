    <h1>Investigating AI's Role in UX Research with Stakeholder Interviews</h1>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>On the first day of my internship, I was assigned to a project called "Smartly Integrate AI with UX Research." Although the current landscape is characterized by significant push towards artificial intelligence, I recognized that it would be premature to assume that AI was the most suitable solution. Instead, I chose to prioritize an in-depth analysis of the underlying problems and challenges, rather than rushing to apply AI as a potential fix.</p>
        <p>I spent the first two weeks conducting informal stakeholder interviews with over a dozen people from the UX team to investigate the pain points in the UX process. Speaking with designers, researchers, and managers about their workflows not only provided insights into the UX process at Broadcom, but it also offered a valuable perspective on the career paths and approaches of others in the field.</p>
        <p>Identified challenges included difficulties in finding participants and understanding user contexts, as well as communication gaps in the UX research process that were significantly hindering the workflow. It was this last point in particular, where I saw an opportunity for improvement using AI.</p>

      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>Researchers and designers often work on complex systems and analyze vast amounts of unstructured data, but managers and stakeholders can sometimes struggle to keep track of ongoing activities. Much meeting time is spent explaining context and updating others on the work being done, rather than optimizing time for feedback or exchanging new ideas.</p>
        <p>I saw this as an opportunity to experiment with AI tools for summarization and rapid analysis to streamline the research process and enhance collaboration within the UX team.</p>

    <h1>Practical Applications and Challenges of AI in UX Research</h1>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>When considering use cases for AI in UX research, AI's strengths lie in coding, tagging to categorize similar findings, sorting through patterns, and leveraging extensive data sets. For my project, I focused on using these capabilities to create executive summaries from unstructured data gathered during user sessions.</p>
        <p>Using LM Studio, a framework designed to deploy large language models on local machines, I experimented with various open-source models from Hugging Face by configuring prompts, temperatures, configuration files, and GPU settings. I tested the accuracy of the AI configurations by using raw, unstructured qualitative data from previous usability studies as inputs and comparing the summary output with what was produced by the researcher at the time.</p>
        <p>In this iterative process of testing different models and configurations against a number of datasets, I created an "AI UX research assistant" that was able to produce executive summaries that had a high accuracy against executive summaries produced by researchers.</p>

    <h1>Case Study: Testing AI on Design System Documentation Research Study</h1>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>To evaluate whether the AI improved the UX research process, I applied my findings from the experiments to a research project I conducted in collaboration with a Principal UX researcher at Broadcom.</p>
        <p>The project focused on the documentation website for the Precision Design system, used by almost all Mainframe Software products. This involved creating a research plan and session guide, working with a designer on alternative designs, conducting interviews and usability testing, analyzing notes, and summarizing findings into an executive summary.</p>
        <p>During this process, an obstacle was keeping the Principal UX researcher updated about each of the usability interviews she was unable to attend. With over ten user sessions and many tasks, it was challenging to balance my own note-taking with producing executive summaries for each session.</p>
        <p>By feeding my notes and transcripts into LM Studio, I produced accurate and concise summaries in seconds - transforming communication between me and the stakeholders on this project.</p>

    <h1>Challenges</h1>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>While I succeeded in generating AI summaries from my notes, I still encountered challenges. I found that while my notes were easily understood by the AI and produced reliable summaries and findings, summarizing from raw transcripts faced token limitations and often lacked the context needed to produce useful summaries.</p>
        <p>Additionally, while the model handled notes in various document types and writing styles from different researchers, the phrase "garbage in, garbage out" proved true for working with AI. Notes that use a lot of shorthand or lack detail are not always "readable", sometimes resulting in summaries that do not accurately reflect what happened during the session. AI cannot compensate for incomplete note-taking, which remains a human problem that technology cannot solve.</p>

    <h1>Future Steps</h1>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>Ultimately, further research needs to be conducted to evaluate how AI tooling fits into the workflow of a larger team. Specifically, it is crucial that there are established channels of communication for this technology to be effective in improving workflows.</p>
        <p>While challenges and limitations exist, I firmly believe that incorporating AI has the potential to greatly enhance UX research, particularly with respect to proactively generating summaries and readouts for leadership. In the future, I would be really interested to see how the same technology can be used for other areas of UX research, such as coding and thematic analysis.</p>
