            <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p><a href="https://involvemint.io/" target="_blank">InvolveMINT</a> is an economic development nonprofit that aims to promote social and environmental change by hosting a Community Currency (CC) on their web application. ChangeMakers earn CCs by contributing to sustainable projects (like community gardens), which can then be redeemed for tangible goods or used to fund projects.</p>
              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>ChangeMakers struggled to receive credit for their volunteer work due to the lack of a "Proof of Impact" submission â€“ a photo of their contribution that community partners could verify.</p>

        <p>Formerly called the "Proof of Impact", this feature of the mobile app allows users to choose a volunteer activity, specify where they want the credits to count towards, and log the completion of their work hours. This information then gets sent to a Community Partner, who verifies the work so that InvolveMINT can credit the ChangeMaker for their work.<br><br>
          The sample scenario we created for the mockup involved a ChangeMaker starting a "Clearing Japanese Knotweed" activity at Fairfield Community Garden.</p>

      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>In this study, we aimed to investigate user preferences regarding two different credit verification methods for tracking progress: taking a before and after photo versus using a timer to clock in and out along with before and after photos. The study was conducted through two distinct tests, Test A and Test B, each employing different sequences of actions to assess user experiences and preferences.</p>

    <h1>Challenge</h1>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p> The primary challenge encountered during the study was related to user participation, specifically in engaging participants in scheduled Zoom calls. Given that many people in our survey database no longer volunteered at the same environmental organizations, it was challenging to incentivize their participation in the study effectively.<br><br>
          Some strategies we used to overcome this challenge include:</p>
        <ul class="unordered-list">
          <li>Offering non-monetary incentives (InvolveMINT Credits)</li>
          <li>Offering flexible scheduling</li>
             <li>Collaborating with student organizations and student-run community gardens</li>
           <li>Maintaining regular communication and follow-ups</li>

    <h1>Results</h1>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>The A and B testing specifications involved two distinct approaches to credit verification tracking, with Test A incorporating a clock-in and out mechanism alongside before and after photos, and Test B focusing solely on photo documentation. Despite challenges related to user participation, the study's finding revealed a strong user preference for clock-in/out-based tracking, highlighting the appeal of monitoring the actual time spent on activities.</p>
