            <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>This mock up was created to address the following prompt: A new music venue has opened up in the heart of the Pittsburgh nightlife, Southside! PGHMusicHall offers a state of the art musical experience and is drawing top tiered acts looking for a more intimate show with the 300 max seating capacity. PGHMusicHall is fully independent and they are looking to sell tickets online themselves.</p>
              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>Many music venues overwhelm their customers with too many events and options. PGH Music Hall aims to simplify the ticket ordering process by going directly to the customer.</p>

      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>Since PGH Music Hall is located in Southside, a neighborhood in Pittsburgh known for its numerous bars and nightlife, it was important for the User Persona to capture the party-going patrons that would use the ticketing platform. Maddie, an outgoing, spontaneous young professional with disposable income, was the type of user that we wanted to cater to.</p>

    <h1>Wireframe and Scenario</h1>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>Using Figma, I created a gray-scale wireframe for PGH Music Hall. I wanted to focus on what makes the ticketing system unique and intuitive rather than focusing on colors and fonts at this stage. Instead of overwhelming patrons with many different concert options like some other venues, PGH Music Hall has a system where returning patrons get exclusive access to the next concert through their registered email and account.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="case-study-description">
        <h3>Scenario for usability testing:</h3>
        <p>"You (Maddie) have just received a notification from PGH Music Hall in your email. Your task is to obtain 2 tickets for the ticket tier closest to the stage at PGH Music Hall for the event on October 19th. Navigate through the ticket booking process online, exploring seat selection, payment, and confirmation."</p>

      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>I conducted usability testing on 8 subject (all in their 20s like the user persona) as well as received feedback from my professor. From the usability testing, I gained valuable feedback about what was/wasn't intuitive and what changes I need to make. This included changing the wording on the ticketing button from "Tickets" to "Get Tickets" and adding a progress bar to the checkout page.</p>

        <p>Building off of the wireframe by adding a few more frames, I created this hi-fi mockup for PGH Music Hall. In the future, I could see this ticketing website expanded in scope to include a Patron Profile page with Maddie's past history, upcoming concerts, and personal coupons.<br><br>I received an A+ on this midterm project! Thank you so much for reading through this case study.</p>
