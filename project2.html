            <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>StoryWorlds is an open-source web-based system for collecting, storing, connecting, and presenting traditional knowledge in the form of stories, myths, and testimonies from multiple cultures and languages. The research team at the University of Pittsburgh School of Computing and Information is working to pilot the application in the context of Ecuadorian Kichwa, with stories and associated media in Spanish and English.</p>
              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>An interface design for StoryWorlds that effectively stored and shared traditional knowledge and folklore needed to be created from scratch.</p>

        <h3>1. Evaluation of Existing Interface</h3>
        <p>My mentor, Dr. Dmitriy Babichenko, had created a bare-bones interface that incorporated the key ideas of using tags and colored nodes. However, challenges arose from overlapping tags, impacting the readability of content categorization and suggesting the need for improved usability in tag organization.</p>

        <h3>2. Comparison with Other Knowledge-Based Software</h3>
        <p>Analyzing the usability of other softwares that use a graph-based or knowledge-based format (Obsidian and Tinderbox) I was able to compare and contrast their features and consider what designs I wanted to implement for the StoryWorlds project. Obsidian's intuitive Markdown-based editor and graph-based visualization, as well as Tinderbox's unique spatial organization features, helped me identify best practices and refine my own interface design.</p>

        <p>Formerly called the "Proof of Impact", this feature of the mobile app allows users to choose a volunteer activity, specify where they want the credits to count towards, and log the completion of their work hours. This information then gets sent to a Community Partner, who verifies the work so that InvolveMINT can credit the ChangeMaker for their work.<br>The sample scenario we created for the mockup involved a ChangeMaker starting a "Clearing Japanese Knotweed" activity at Fairfield Community Garden.</p>

      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p> The primary challenge encountered during the study was related to user participation, specifically in engaging participants in scheduled Zoom calls. Given that many people in our survey database no longer volunteered at the same environmental organizations, it was challenging to incentivize their participation in the study effectively.<br>Some strategies we used to overcome this challenge include:</p>
        <ul class="unordered-list">
          <li>Offering non-monetary incentives (InvolveMINT Credits)</li>
          <li>Offering flexible scheduling</li>
             <li>Collaborating with student organizations and student-run community gardens</li>

      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>The A and B testing specifications involved two distinct approaches to credit verification tracking, with Test A incorporating a clock-in and out mechanism alongside before and after photos, and Test B focusing solely on photo documentation. Despite challenges related to user participation, the study's finding revealed a strong user preference for clock-in/out-based tracking, highlighting the appeal of monitoring the actual time spent on activities.</p>
