    <h1>Research Methodology</h1>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-description">
          <p>To capture a holistic view of the POGOH experience, I utilized a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data analysis and qualitative user interviews.</p>
            <h3>1. Quantitative Analysis</h3>
            <p>The quantitative analysis focused on a dataset comprising 27,414 POGOH trips over a one-month period. Key data points included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trip frequency:</strong> identifying the most popular start and end locations.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Ride duration:</strong> analyzing average ride time and frequency of short versus long trips.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Peak usage times:</strong> understanding peak and off-peak times based on user demand patterns.</li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            <p>This initial analysis revealed insights into POGOH’s role in “micro-commutes,” or short, frequent trips often within a limited area, such as the University of Pittsburgh campus. It highlighted a critical mismatch between the current pricing structure and actual user needs, with most rides being much shorter than the allotted membership times.</p>
            <h3>2. Qualitative Research</h3>
        <p>To deepen my understanding, I conducted 14 interviews with a diverse range of users. Interview participants included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular Riders:</strong> Individuals who use POGOH as their main transportation mode for short distances.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Occasional Riders:</strong> Users who incorporate POGOH as a secondary mode of transport.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Non-Riders:</strong> Potential users who had considered but ultimately avoided using the service.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <p>Participants provided nuanced insights into the practical challenges and perceived value of bike-sharing in Pittsburgh, such as frustrations with bike availability, concerns about safety, and confusion regarding pricing and memberships.</p>

    <h1>Key Insights</h1>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>The research revealed five primary insights that highlighted both the strengths of the POGOH system and areas for UX improvement:</p>
            
          <h3>1. Short Trips and Micro-Commutes Dominate Usage</h3>
            <p>Analyzing ride data, I found that most trips on POGOH bikes last around five minutes. This contrasts sharply with the 30-60 minutes that a membership typically includes, suggesting a mismatch between pricing and actual user behavior. The high frequency of “micro-commutes” — short trips between university buildings, transit stations, and shopping centers — indicates that users are primarily leveraging POGOH for very short, point-to-point journeys.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> A pricing model tailored to short, frequent trips could encourage more usage among students and commuters. For instance, offering reduced-cost “micro-commute” plans would align more closely with user behavior.</p>

              <img src="pogoh/bargraph.png" alt="pogoh" class="work-image">
            </div>

            <h3>2. Availability Affects Trust in the System</h3>
            <p>In interviews, participants cited inconsistent bike and docking availability as a major frustration. Many reported instances where bikes or docks were unavailable, particularly during rush hours. This lack of reliability undermines trust, as users cannot confidently plan their trips around POGOH.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> To build trust in availability, POGOH could implement a real-time availability feature within its app. Users would be able to see available bikes and docks at their destination, making it easier to plan trips and feel secure about their transportation choice.</p>

            <div class="case-study-image">
            <img src="pogoh/top10map.png" alt="pogoh" class="work-image">
            </div>

            <h3>3. Safety Concerns Discourage Adoption</h3>
            <p>Safety emerged as a significant barrier to POGOH usage, particularly for newer or hesitant users. Participants expressed concerns about navigating busy streets with limited bike lanes and shared negative experiences with navigating certain areas of the city on a bike. This issue was especially prominent among riders unfamiliar with urban cycling.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Partnering with the city to improve bike-friendly infrastructure — such as protected lanes and clear signage — would make POGOH a safer, more appealing option. Additionally, offering resources like “safety tips” in the app could ease new users’ concerns and encourage more consistent ridership.</p>

            <h3>4. Sign-Up Process is Too Complex</h3>
            <p>Many participants found the sign-up process, particularly for the Mobility Justice Membership (a reduced-rate option), unnecessarily complicated. Confusion around eligibility, required documentation, and unclear instructions created friction for individuals who otherwise wanted to use POGOH but were deterred by these barriers.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Simplifying the sign-up process, including making eligibility requirements clearer and more accessible, could lower the threshold for entry, especially among underserved groups. Highlighting affordable membership options within the app could also encourage wider adoption.</p>

            <h3>5. Lack of Awareness and Social Perceptions</h3>
            <p>Interviews revealed that some potential users were unaware of the membership options or didn’t feel that bike-sharing was a socially viable option for them. For some, biking was associated more with recreation than with daily commuting, and they felt unsure about whether POGOH could meet their needs.</p>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> A targeted awareness campaign that positions POGOH as a sustainable, affordable transportation option could help shift perceptions and drive adoption. Integrating testimonials from diverse riders and emphasizing the benefits of bike-sharing could encourage hesitant users to give the system a try.</p>

    <h1>Reflection and Future Directions</h1>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>Working on the POGOH bike-sharing project was an eye-opener into how real-world usability can diverge from system design intentions. I started with a focus on app usability and basic system accessibility, but the user interviews quickly shifted my understanding. For many users, unpredictable bike availability was a bigger issue than app navigation, as it directly impacted their willingness to rely on POGOH for daily commutes. This insight reminded me that usability in urban transportation goes beyond digital touchpoints—it’s about reliability and trust in the system.</p>
        <p>The project also taught me the importance of considering the entire user journey. While the POGOH app could improve, the physical environment—like bike lanes and docking station locations—shaped much of the experience. Observing users in person underscored how road safety and infrastructure can make or break urban mobility solutions. This learning has inspired me to think about future design solutions in a broader context, collaborating with city planning or transportation departments where possible to improve the overall experience.</p>
        <p>Finally, this project reinforced the value of mixed-method research. The quantitative data provided a snapshot of usage trends, but it was the qualitative insights that painted a fuller picture of the users’ motivations and frustrations. As I look to future projects, I’m excited to apply these lessons to design solutions that truly resonate with users’ needs while supporting broader goals, like sustainable urban transportation.</p>
