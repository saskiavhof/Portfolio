      <h1>I'm Saskia Van't Hof.</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Japan as a Dutch-American, I have always been interested in the way language and culture affect how things look â€“ especially interface design.</p>
      <p>At the University of Pittsburgh, I am a Frederick Honors scholar studying Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (with minors in Spanish and Global Studies). By majoring in DNID, a joint program between the Computer Science and English departments, I am able to pursue advanced coding projects while also having the space to research how liberal arts shape human-computer interaction.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I love to go on hikes and try out new recipes. As proud as I am of the work on this website, I'm pretty sure my food Instagram account (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/saskia.makes/" target="_blank">@saskia.makes</a>) is my magnum opus.</p>

      <h1> My career so far...</h1>
      <p>I first fell in love with design during my two years as the Editor-in-Chief of my high school newspaper. As I transitioned the newspaper's focus from print to digital, I became fascinated with the possibilities that website design offered. As I began my studies as a Frederick Honors Scholar at the University of Pittsburgh, I decided to major in Interaction Design with concentrations in User Experience and Human-Computer Interaction research.</p>
      <p>In 2022, I became the Designer of Forbes & Fifth, an interdisciplinary research journal at the University of Pittsburgh. Beyond designing the layout, I also created dozens of graphics for each each, designed a new logo for the office, and updated the website. The research jounral also gave me first-hand experience editing academic research papers, which greatly influenced my decision to conduct my own research in the field of UX.</p>
      <p>I began researching at the University of Pittsburgh School of Computing and Information that school year. With researchers in Pittsburgh and Ecuador, I spent the summer of 2023 designing an open-source interface for preserving Indigenous folklore and traditional ecological knowledge. </p>
      <p>Along with research, I also interned as a UX designer at InvolveMINT, a nonprofit economic development agency in Pittsburgh that aims to award credits to volunteers for environmental work.</p>
      <p>In 2024, I became more involved in UX research in the business, specifically its application in AI products. I worked as an AI intern for NIIT, a top professional development and training services company, where I used machine learning and quantitative modeling to create realistic simulations of oil trading markets as part of a custom training course for a top oil company. Additionally, I trained an AI on qualitative data from the presales team to generate slide decks based on pitches from the sales team, optimizing the workflow of the team.</p>
      <p>With this experience in using AI to build team capacity, I joined Broadcom as a UX research intern to explore the possibilities of AI within UX workflows.</p>
      <p>I am currently looking for full time roles following my graduation in May of 2025. Thank you so much for checking out my page!</p>

      <h1> My career so far...</h1>
      <p>As a UX enthusiast, I've been fortunate to work with some amazing organizations and individuals. From redesigning the Forbes & Fifth research journal's website and creating graphics for each edition, to researching an open-source interface for preserving Indigenous folklore and traditional ecological knowledge in Ecuador, every experience has taught me something new about the power of design.</p>
      <p>In the past year, I've had the chance to apply my UX skills in more business-focused settings. As a UX designer at InvolveMINT, a techs startup, I worked on projects that combined environmental work with interface design. And as an AI intern for NIIT, I explored the potential of machine learning and quantitative modeling to create realistic simulations of complex systems.
      <p>Now, as a UX research intern at Broadcom, I'm excited to dive deeper into the possibilities of AI within UX workflows. With graduation on the horizon (May 2025 can't come soon enough!), I'm looking forward to applying my skills in a full-time role.</p>
