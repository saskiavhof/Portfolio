            <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>StoryWorlds is an open-source web-based system for collecting, storing, connecting, and presenting traditional knowledge in the form of stories, myths, and testimonies from multiple cultures and languages. The research team at the University of Pittsburgh School of Computing and Information, in partnership with academics in Ecuador, is working to pilot the application in the context of Ecuadorian Kichwa, with stories and associated media in Spanish and English.</p>
            <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>As we began designing the initial iteration/proof of concept for StoryWorlds, several key challenges emerged: ensuring cultural accuracy and sensitivity, addressing language and accessibility barriers, and fostering community engagement and buy-in.</p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
              <p>I conducted stakeholder interviews with 20+ academics across the United States as well as community members in Ecuador. Then, I used these perspectives to thoughtfully design a proof of concept for an interface that could effectively store stories for the Ecuadorian Quechuan community. </p>

        <h3>1. Evaluation of Existing Interface</h3>
        <p>My mentor, Dr. Dmitriy Babichenko, had created a bare-bones interface that incorporated the key ideas of using tags and colored nodes. However, challenges arose from overlapping tags, impacting the readability of content categorization and suggesting the need for improved usability in tag organization.</p>

        <h3>2. Comparison with Other Knowledge-Based Software</h3>
        <p>Analyzing the usability of other softwares that use a graph-based or knowledge-based format (Obsidian and Tinderbox) I was able to compare and contrast their features and consider what designs I wanted to implement for the StoryWorlds project. Obsidian's intuitive Markdown-based editor and graph-based visualization, as well as Tinderbox's unique spatial organization features, helped me identify best practices and refine my own interface design.</p>

    <div class="case-study-content">
      <!-- Explanation for the user flow -->
      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p>I interviewed over a dozen academics in the fields of Anthropology, Indigenous Studies, Linguistics, Computer Science, Sociology, and Political Science over the course of May and June, gathering diverse perspectives that enriched the research process.

          <br>Gathering their insights, I presented a summary of questions, concerns, and suggestions on six key themes to professors in Pittsburgh and Ecuador. These were some main themes:</p>

        <p>Wanting to address the specific concerns raised during interviews and incorporating valuable feedback from collaborators, I revised some screens of the mockup. This iterative process involved enhancing the user interface to ensure cultural sensitivity, improving the search functionality for easy accessibility, and implementing clickable elements for auditory learning experiences. Additionally, I created new screens with innovative features, such as localized image displays and interactive storytelling components, enhancing the overall usability and cultural relevance of the StorWworlds project.</p>

      <div class="case-study-description">
        <p> The primary challenge encountered during the study was related to user participation, specifically in engaging participants in scheduled Zoom calls. Given that many people in our survey database no longer volunteered at the same environmental organizations, it was challenging to incentivize their participation in the study effectively.<br>Some strategies we used to overcome this challenge include:</p>
        <ul class="unordered-list">
          <li>Offering non-monetary incentives (InvolveMINT Credits)</li>
          <li>Offering flexible scheduling</li>
             <li>Collaborating with student organizations and student-run community gardens</li>
           <li>Maintaining regular communication and follow-ups</li>

        <p>Finally, I used my Figma mockup to transport the submission screens, the tagging screens, and the search screens into an interactive web-based system.
