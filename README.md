**Saskia Van't Hof**

**UX/UI Designer and Web Developer**



Hi, I'm Saskia!
I design experiences that **_connect_**.

Born and raised in Japan as a Dutch-American, I have always been interested in the way language and culture affect how things look â€“ especially interface design.

At the University of Pittsburgh, I am a Frederick Honors scholar studying Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (with minors in Spanish and Global Studies). By majoring in DNID, a joint program between the Computer Science and English departments, I am able to pursue advanced coding projects while also having the space to research how liberal arts shape human-computer interaction.

In my free time, I love to go on hikes and try out new recipes. As proud as I am of the work on this website, I'm pretty sure my food Instagram account (@saskia.makes) is my magnum opus.
