<h1> Hi, I'm Saskia!
I design experiences that connect. </h1>
Currently, I am studying Digital Narrative and Interactive Design at the University of Pittsburgh and working as a UX/UI designer and researcher. My primary focus lies in exploring the impact of cross-cultural communication on interface design.
