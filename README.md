Hi, I'm **Saskia**!
I design experiences that **connect**.

Currently, I am studying Digital Narrative and Interactive Design at the University of Pittsburgh and working as a UX/UI designer and researcher. My primary focus lies in exploring the impact of cross-cultural communication on interface design.
